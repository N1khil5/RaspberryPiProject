# RaspberryPiProject
This Raspberry Pi project is to create a web server that can allow users to buy concert tickets. When the web server is online, a user on the network can access the webpage if they are on the same network to enter the ticket buying store. Once the user buys the ticket, the webpage provides the user with a pdf file of the ticket with a ticket ID to differentiate that ticket from the other tickets that were sold. Tickets sold are recorded in a database, and once the tickets are scanned, an alert comes up on the screen to signify that the ticket has been used and the ticket will be removed from the database so no one else can use the same ticket again. The project utilises HTML, PHP, MySQL and third-party libraries.
